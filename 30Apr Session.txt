Let's backtrack a little bit:
There are a few things in life that everyone needs.

0) A good resource. I'm basing many of these lists off of software carpentry (thanks Swapil):
https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/


1) a text editor
notepad++
sublime
atom
nano
eclipse
emacs
vim
visual studio
spyder
pycharm


2) bash and cmd commands
http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/
ls | dir
man
cd
pwd
~
mkdir
rm | del
mv | move
cp | copy
>, <, and |


3) Git's basic commands
http://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/
status
commit
remote
pull
push


4) Python - the Very Basics
http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-gapminder/
   A. Start a jupyter notebook:
      in bash or cmd:
      > jupyter notebook

      if that doesn't work:
      pip install --upgrade jupyter

      Open the notebook 'VeryBasics.ipynb'
      
   B. Say hello
      print('Hello')
      
   C. Save a variable
      x = 5

   D. Variables can be strings
      name = 'Excalibur'

   E. Variables can be indexed
      subname = name[1]
      print(subname)

   F. Indexing can access multiple elements
      print(name[0:5])

   G. Everything works with Numpy
      import numpy
      x = numpy.array([1, 2, 3])
      y = x[1]
      print(x[2])
      print(y*x[1:3])


5) The built-in python functions
https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html

open()

6) Python packages and member functions

f = open(<file>)
f.read()

import sys
sys.argv[1]

7) Let's talk about say.py, scripts.py, and readFile.py
This function takes a file name from the command line, reads its contents, and prints them back to the command line.
